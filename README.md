getting and cleaning data project
=================================

This repository contains the following files:

- run_analysis.R
- codebook.md
- tidy.txt (The csv file has been stored as txt as csv are not allowed on coursera)

The "run_analysis.R" file contains the R code that can be used to achieve the following: 
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The codebook.md file describes the output files of run_analysis.R (tidy.txt) the variables, and work that performed to clean up the data.
